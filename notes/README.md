This program is used for taking notes within talon. It uses sqlite to store your notes. All voice commands are modeled off how you would take notes in a notebook. For instance,  using verbs like erase, pencil, or switch. 

 The default page  is called "general". You can create new pages by specifying a page name. You can then switch between them. This behavior is intended to group similar notes under a similar page. Finally you can either delete individual notes by specifying their id as they appear in the GUI or instead by deleting the entire page with which they are located by using trash page.

 You can use the export notes command to export all of your notes to a text file or back it up.
