markdown is nice given the fact that there is so much tooling support
I generally find it faster to write just give the fact that there is so much tooling. you can just write the plain text and then the markdown renderer will handle the visual styling

markdown files Have significantly less overhead than a word file and as a result are sAt all wordmaller and quicker to search ( and lighter weight on the processor)
since markdown files are just plaintext, it is easy to write scripts to automatically manipulate content within them (ie it would be trivial to automatically add a header within 100 files at once)

there are auto formatters for markdown that automatically remove unnecessary spaces, abnormal indents, etc

markdown can be compiled easily to word but compiling back and forth frequently really isn't a good idea since you want to have one source of truth. so it is best to compile to the new format at a key transition in the project, such as transitioning from drafting to the final report

- after you compile then you can take advantage of any word specific features like the grammar correction

- A brief example of some markdown text that I wrote in another project. See how it is tracked in git and can have comments

Best way to start is probably trying it out just for drafting

git allows for fine grained version control without affecting the visual styling or editing process

- just automatically keeps track of every change you made and then stores it in the repository when you back up the markdown file
