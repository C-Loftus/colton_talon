Things we went over:
- By default talon starts in command mode, to enter dictation mode say "dictation mode"
-  if you want to enter text within command mode you need to say "say" and then the text you want to enter
   -   instead of 'say' you can also say a formatter name at the start to custom format the text
   - ie 'camel'  formats as camel case
   - ie 'snake'  formats as snake case
   - ie 'sentence' formats as sentence with a capital letter at the start
-  by default the talon beta does not come with mixed mode and in order to enable mixed mode you have to copy in the pinned message from the talon slack
   -   mixed mode allows to stay both commands or dictation
-   in order to have the best recognition for what we are trying to say we should dictate longer sentences so it has more context

Things  I recommend looking at for next time:
-  install visual studio code and the talon extension for syntax highlighting 
   -  as you start to make any sort of changes or custom commands for your set up you are good to want to make sure you have syntax highlighting to preemptively prevent errors
-  install https://github.com/david-tejada/rango-talon for better web navigation
   -   if the installation is confusing just let me know han we can wait until next time to go over it
